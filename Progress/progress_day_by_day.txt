Progress day by day:

2021/09/30  1. I updated my notebook. 
            2. Search about how to detect tobacco plant with NDVI.
            3. I was expected to rewrite some functions in my notebook and python script but I didn't finish.

2021/10/01  1. Search about how to detect tobacco plant with NDVI but I didn't find anything interesting.
            2. Update my functions but it is not working as well as I wanted.

2021/10/04  1. I updated my downloading and display map fonctions.
            2. I try to use k-means on NDVI file in order to found more information but I need to read
               more about how to get a good interpretation from the result I got.
               
2021/10/05  1. I search and read about dimensionality reduction techniques.
            2. I try to apply PCA on NDVI but I got an error but still trying.
            
2021/10/06  1. I did not reach yesterday's goal about PCA because I found it can be useless
            2. I did some explorations VARI and WDRI.
            3. I did the scatter plot between band 4 and 8 but it doesn't give me information or I am not able to come with a clear interpretation.

2021/10/07  1. Make research about how to use get time series unsing NDVI

2021/10/08  1. Read papers about time series with NDVI

2021/10/07  1. Implementation of NDVI time series with Landsat 8 dataset
            2. Read about NDVI time series analysis
